# Midi-Telecaster-Guitar

A Telecaster guitar with analog tone, LED visual feedback, and piezo MIDI. LEDs flash when played via USB power, and MIDI notes are sent through a Raspberry Pi Pico for use in DAW (Digital audio workstaion)
The PCB is purely a wiring hub to connect 4 piezos neatly to the Pico via USB.
